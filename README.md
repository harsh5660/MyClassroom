# Student Database Record
# Course Objective:
Student Database Records have become an important factor in the modern education field. This 
system should help the institution to streamline the administrative task and provide real-time 
access to the data. Building this system in a C language interface will further help ease 
accessibility. The study findings enable the definition of the project problem statement, its 
objectives, scopes, and advantages of the Student Database Record. Student Database Record 
streamlines data collection, storage & retrieval, and records management to improve
operational (admission, registration, scheduling, examination, and grading) and management 
tasks (planning, evaluation, and decision-making). It focuses on storing & processing 
curriculum data, student data, and producing outputs supporting the operational activities. 
These outputs include student cards, subject descriptions, schedules, and management 
information.

This project is helpful for managing student information by adding, updating, removing, viewing, searching and individual view of each student.

# Outcomes:
Student Database Record can be utilized by instructive establishments to keep up with their 
understudy records without any problem. Accomplishing this goal is troublesome involving 
the manual framework as the data is dissipated, can be excess, and gathering important data 
might be extremely tedious. This multitude of issues is addressed by this venture. This 
framework helps in keeping up with the data of understudies of the association. The manager 
can easily access it and keep it safe for a long period without any changes.
